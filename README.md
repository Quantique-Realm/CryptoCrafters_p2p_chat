# Peer-to-Peer Encrypted Chat Network

A decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) encrypted chat system using Python, allowing secure communication between peers over a network.
**Also handles the bonus feature connecting to peers.**

## Features
- **Peer Discovery**: Uses UDP broadcasting to find and list active peers on the network.(Extra)
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using AES (Fernet) and RSA for secure transmission.
- **TCP-Based Communication**: Sends and receives encrypted messages using TCP sockets.
- **Chat History**: Stores messages in an SQLite database for retrieval.
- **Dynamic Peer Management**: Updates and maintains a list of connected peers.
- **Multi-Threaded Server**: Handles multiple connections simultaneously.
- **Automatic Peer Status Check**: Detects inactive peers and removes them.(Extra)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install cryptography pycryptodome
pip install argparse
``` 
## Steps to run chat.py file
#### **Step 1: Run the Peer**  
To start a peer, use the following command:  

```bash
python peer_chat.py --name <YourName> --port <PortNumber>
```

For example:  

```bash
python peer_chat.py --name Alice --port 5000
python peer_chat.py --name Bob --port 5001
```

Each peer must have a **unique name** and **port number**.  

#### **Step 2: Using the Chat Application**  
Once the peer is running, you will see a menu:  

```
***** Menu *****
1. Send message  
2. Query active peers  
3. View chat history  
4. Connect to active peer  
0. Quit  
```

- **Option 1:** Enter the target peer's IP and port to send a message.  
- **Option 2:** View the list of currently active peers.  
- **Option 3:** Display saved chat history.  
- **Option 4:** Manually connect to another peer.  
- **Option 0:** Exit the application.  

#### **Step 3: Stopping a Peer**  
To stop a peer, type `"exit"` in the chat or press **Ctrl + C**.  

## How It Works
1. **Key Generation**: RSA and AES keys are generated for secure communication.
2. **Peer Discovery**: Peers broadcast their availability using UDP.
3. **Message Encryption**: Messages are encrypted before sending and decrypted upon receipt.
4. **Secure Communication**: Messages are transmitted over a TCP connection.
5. **Chat History**: All messages are stored locally in an SQLite database.

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ PeerChat
 â”œâ”€â”€ chat.py        # Main script for peer-to-peer communication
 â”œâ”€â”€ secret.key          # AES encryption key
 â”œâ”€â”€ private.pem         # RSA private key
 â”œâ”€â”€ public.pem          # RSA public key
 â”œâ”€â”€ peers.json          # Stores discovered peers
 â”œâ”€â”€ chat_history.db     # SQLite database for storing chat messages
```

## Security
- **AES Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using AES (Fernet) for confidentiality.
- **RSA Encryption**: RSA is used for secure key exchanges.
- **Peer Authentication**: Peers must identify themselves using a team name.
- **Encrypted Broadcasts**: UDP discovery messages are encrypted to prevent spoofing.
